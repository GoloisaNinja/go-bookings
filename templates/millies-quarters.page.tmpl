                    Get away from it all in this modern and stunningly beautiful
                    booking. You and your doggos can bask in the sun on the large patio
                    while listening to the frogs playing the garden fountain. This
                    booking is very close to several popular restaurants and club
                    venues. Of course, in this setting, you'll probably just want to
                    order in.

                        "We could not have had a better time at this booking! The house
                        was immaculate and well cared for. The love that the owners put
                        into the dog bedroom was just adorable. Our little cloud dogs
                        loved having 6 beds to sleep in. They kept choosing different beds
                        every night! The pool and patio area was beautiful and, I have to
                        say, the frog fountain was my favourite! There were singing
                        frogs!"
